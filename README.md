# Let's Code Tutorial

## About this tutorial
Welcome to **Let's Code** tutorial. \
This tutorial will help you learn the basic of Golang, Docker, MySQL, Protocol Buffer and Ecommerce integration.
There will be three assignments which are **Let's Start** (elementary), **Let's Go** (intermediate) and **Let's Run** (advanced).
With each assignment, there will be a number of repositories which contain the instruction for learning and practising accordingly.
The first repository of each assignment will contain the overall information about the assignment, 
which helps you understand the general objective, what to do, what to learn and what to expect as the learning outcome.

## Assignment
### 1. Let's Start
#### What to expect
This assignment will introduce the fundamental knowledge of Golang, Docker, MySQL and Protocol Buffer.
Each repository in this assignment will represent a part of the knowledge listed above.
The instruction to learn and practice can be found in the `README.md` file of each repository.

#### Repositories
1.1. [Let's Start](https://github.com/dinhtp/lets-start) \
1.2. [Let's Start Golang](https://github.com/dinhtp/lets-start-docker) \
1.3. [Let's Start Docker](https://github.com/dinhtp/lets-go-company) \
1.4. [Let's Start MySQL](https://github.com/dinhtp/lets-start-mysql) \
1.4. [Let's Start Proto](https://github.com/dinhtp/lets-start-proto)

### 2. Let's Go
#### What to expect
In this assignment, you will implement the knowledge acquired from the **Let's Start** assignment to build a simple API service.
This service will accept some basic actions of Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) and other advanced listing request.
More instruction about the implementation can be found in the `README.md` file of each repository.

#### Repositories
2.1. [Let's Go](https://github.com/dinhtp/lets-go) \
2.2. [Let's Go PbType](https://github.com/dinhtp/lets-go-pbtype) \
2.3. [Let's Go Company](https://github.com/dinhtp/lets-go-company) \
2.4. [Let's Go Project](https://github.com/dinhtp/lets-go-project)

### 3. Let's Run
#### What to expect
In this assignment, you are required to build a customer API service which integrates with multiple ecommerce platforms.
From one single service, the API request will branch out and sync to the designated ecommerce platform.
The synchronization should happen in both ways (from the ecommerce platforms to the customer service and vice versa)
More instruction about the implementation can be found in the `README.md` file of each repository.
